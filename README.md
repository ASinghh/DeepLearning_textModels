I have done this work as a part of the Advanced Deep Learning course taken by Vincent Vanhoucke of the Google Brain Team. I had used tensor flow to 
write code to convert words from a lage text into a vector( word to vec) and answer the relevant question asked in the assignments.

1. Have also worked on the Bag of words model
2. bigram model
3. Skip gram model.

Have used the standard arcitecture as described in the course.

Please go through the assignments and play arround the codes to see more
